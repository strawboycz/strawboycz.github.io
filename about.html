Welcome to PARKOURDLE, a unique game inspired by the popular word game Wordle, 
but with a parkour twist!

This project was created to test your knowledge of parkour tricks 
in a fun and engaging way.

I've curated a selection of parkour videos from Instagram 
to provide you with a dynamic and challenging experience.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or if you would like to report a video, 
please feel free to contact me via Instagram(preffered) or email.

If you are a content creator 
and would like to have your video removed from the game, 
or if you would like to contribute your videos, please reach out to me aswell.
